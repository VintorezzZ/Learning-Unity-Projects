Thank you for purchasing and using RCC with this prefab. 

As description says, latest version of the RCC and 3D model of the vehicle must be imported to your project.

Be sure you have created RCC layer and selected in RCC Settings. (Explained in RCC documentation)

Just drag&drop prefabs to your scene, that's it. Have fun!

Best Regards,
Bugra
